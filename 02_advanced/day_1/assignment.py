# GUESSING GAME
# generate a random number (1-100)
# Prompt an user to guess the correct number
# define hints
# difference less than 10 -> close
# difference less than 5 -> really close
# difference more than 11 -> little high
# difference more than 25 -> little too high
# difference more than 40 -> too high
# If user guesses a higher number than correct number, (correct number = 75, user=85) you say close
# You give them 5 tries before saying "Game Over"
# Ask user for username
# Create a game menu
# Options -> View high Score, Leaderboards, Play game
# It should be able to store high scores of multiple users in a file in format ({username: score})
# Example: {"sagar": 10, "harshal": 8...}
